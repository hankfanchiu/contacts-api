# Contacts API

An App Academy project to learn about Rails controllers and routes.

## Structure

- A user can own many contacts and share these contacts.
- A user can have favorite contacts (owned or shared), as well as groups of contacts.
- Either a user or a contact can be commented.

### Custom routes:

- `/contacts/groups` to navigate to a user's grouped contacts
- `/contacts/favorites` to navigate to a user's favorite contacts
