# Contacts API

An App Academy project to learn Rails controllers and routes.

## Structure

- A user can own many contacts and share these contacts.
- A user can have favorite contacts (owned or shared), as well as groups of contacts.
- Either a user or a contact can be commented.

Custom routes under /contacts to navigate to a user's grouped contacts (/contacts/groups) and to a user's favorite contacts (/contacts/favorites).
